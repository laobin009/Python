"""
================================
Nearest Neighbors Classification
================================

Sample usage of Nearest Neighbors classification.
It will plot the decision boundaries for each class.
"""
"""
How to understand the output:
Each  backgroud color shows our models' prediction while each spot is true data.
If the spot locates on the same color area, that means correct prediction.
Otherwise, it is wrong prediction.
We can see that for this data set, distance as weights model has better
performance
