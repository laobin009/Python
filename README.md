I edited the tsatools.py Path:C:\Users\wye\Desktop\Work\Python2\Lib\site-packages\statsmodels\tsa
Adding content to line 585 - line 590 and line 636 - line 641 to avoid "RuntimeWarning:overflow encountered in exp"
Also set maxiter lower than 40 or 30 can avoid this warning.
Check https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40726490/overflow-error-in-pythons-numpy-exp-function for the cause of warning.
